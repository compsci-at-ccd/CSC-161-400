## Computer Science II

### Introduction
This will contain the course files for Computer Science II.  It is important to note that while I (the instructor) will post files here, this is not a place to commit homework (that remains D2L).  You will find the lecture materials in each folder for that lecture number, and any associated homework materials.

### Lecture 1
A quick overview of the course, no code

### Lecture 2
The presentation for this lecture is in three parts:
- Quick Review section and code
- ArrayLists and an Introduction to the Java Collections Framework
- Java keywords
