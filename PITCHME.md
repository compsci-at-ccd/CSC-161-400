### Why is virtualization important to ... Computer Science?
Virtualization
- Already an OS concept: process sees the computer as if alone
- What if we can put an entire OS into a process?
- How can this help us design, develop and specify?

### What do we mean by the Cloud?
Capacity Provisioning -or- virtualization on someone else's hardware
- Pay for what you use
- Highly scalable
- Almost remove capex for IT infrastructure, and "shift" it to opex

### What is the Cloud to Computer Science?
- Separates the solution from the platform
- Allows us to apply considerable resources to difficult problems
