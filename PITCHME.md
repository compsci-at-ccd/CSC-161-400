### Lecture 1

## Overview

- I will lecture from the keyboard
- We will not be using BlueJ, but instead a professional-grade IDE.  We will be doing diagrams in a separate tool as well.
- Before the next class (Lecture 2):
  + The [IntelliJ IDEA IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) (integrated development environment) installed
  + A comfortable way to 'git' (I suggest [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) if you have no experience)

## Principles

- If you do not understand, you have the right to demand a "show me".  This means a demonstration either in class or during office hours.
  + A demonstration means active code, either in class or during office hours.  
  + If the need is best met by posting example code, for some cases I may do that.
- Homework assignments have three parts:
  + Diagram describing the process/workflow
  + Documentation that identifies dependencies, liabilities and important information
  + Source Code
