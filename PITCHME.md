### Special Section: Virtualization and the Cloud
We talked last time about the benefits of virtualization: from virtual machines, containers to the OS.  We installed VirtualBox on our development machines, and ran Ubuntu within it.  Today we will work a bit with Docker, a container engine, and create a workstation on the cloud.
